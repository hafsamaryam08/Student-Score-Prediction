# 📘 Student Score Prediction (Elevvo ML Internship)

This repository contains the implementation of **Task 1: Student Score Prediction** as part of my Elevvo ML Internship.  
The task demonstrates the use of **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** to predict student exam scores based on study hours.

## 🚀 Task Details

### 🔹 Task 1: Student Score Prediction (Linear Regression)
- **Objective:** Predict students' exam scores from study hours.  
- **Requirements:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Steps:**  
  - Load & explore dataset  
  - Data visualization (correlation, scatter plot, regression line)  
  - Train-test split (with `test_size` & `random_state`)  
  - Train Linear Regression model  
  - Evaluate with metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)  
  - Predict scores & visualize results

### 🔹 Bonus Task: Polynomial Regression
- Extended the model using **Polynomial Features** to capture non-linear relationships.  
- Compared Linear vs Polynomial Regression performance.  

---

## 📊 Results
- Linear Regression provided a baseline prediction.  
- Polynomial Regression improved the model by fitting non-linear patterns better.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn
